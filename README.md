# Load Estimation for a Residential Compound

An academic project focused on basic electrical load estimation for a residential compound using the Egyptian Code. The process was carried out using Microsoft Excel and AutoCAD.

## Summary

- Estimated the electrical load for each residential unit based on its area  
- Calculated the total load for the entire compound by summing individual unit loads  
- Applied the same method to estimate:
  - Cofree (distribution boards)
  - Pillar (electrical cabinets) requirements  
- Final results and layout were organized using AutoCAD

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel  
- AutoCAD  
- Egyptian Electrical Code (Low Voltage)

## Notes

- This project was part of coursework in Electrical Power & Machines Engineering â€“ Helwan University  
- Designed for academic purposes using simplified assumptions
