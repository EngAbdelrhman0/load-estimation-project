# Load Estimation for Residential Compound

An academic project to estimate the electrical load of a small residential compound.  
The goal was to calculate the total load and distribute it visually across the compound using AutoCAD.

## Tasks Done

- Estimated the electrical load for each villa based on its area  
- Summed up all villa loads to determine the compound's total load  
- Calculated the number and load capacity of required cofrees and pillars  
- Documented all data and calculations in an Excel sheet  
- Created a basic AutoCAD layout and labeled the main load values  

## Tools Used

- **Microsoft Excel** – for load calculations and data organization  
- **AutoCAD** – for layout creation and electrical load annotation  

## Notes

- Completed as part of academic course at Helwan University  
- Focused on theoretical estimation and clear visual layout using AutoCAD
