# Load Estimation for Residential Compound

An academic project focused on estimating the electrical load for a residential compound.  
The process involved calculating load per unit, summing total demand, and determining the required distribution elements.

## Features

- Calculated electrical load for each villa based on its area  
- Aggregated all villa loads to determine total compound demand  
- Estimated the number and load capacity of required cofrees and pillars  
- Documented all data in a clear AutoCAD layout  

## Process Overview

1. Measured area for each villa  
2. Applied the Egyptian Electrical Code to calculate individual loads  
3. Summed all loads to find the compound’s total demand  
4. Estimated:
   - Cofrees (distribution boards)  
   - Pillars (electrical cabinets)  
   - Load capacity for each  
5. Final layout and load data were added to an AutoCAD drawing  

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel – for applying formulas and organizing load data  
- AutoCAD – to visually represent the load distribution and annotations  

## Additional Notes

- The estimation was based on academic knowledge of load calculation standards  
- No physical implementation or simulation was performed  
- This project was part of electrical engineering coursework at Helwan University
