# Load Estimation for Residential Units

An academic project that demonstrates how to estimate the electrical load for a small residential apartment using Excel.

## Features

- Calculates expected power consumption for common home appliances
- Uses demand factor, diversity factor, and safety margin
- Output includes total load and recommended main breaker size
- Organized in an easy-to-read Excel sheet with formulas and charts

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel  
- Basic Load Calculation Rules (per IEC/NFPA standards)  

## How it Works

1. User inputs number and type of appliances (e.g. lights, fans, AC, TV)
2. Each item has a defined power rating (in watts)
3. Sheet calculates total power, current, and suggests circuit sizes
4. Includes demand factor to reflect realistic load usage
5. Displays total load in kW and amps, with breaker recommendation

## Additional Notes

- This project was created as part of Electrical Power Engineering coursework
- All calculations are based on typical Egyptian household standards
