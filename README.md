# Load Estimation for Residential Compound

An academic project to estimate the electrical load for a small residential compound.  
The goal was to calculate the total demand and size the required distribution components.

## Tasks Done

- Calculated the electrical load for each villa based on its area  
- Used the Egyptian Code to estimate the load for lights, sockets, and ACs  
- Summed up the loads for all villas to get the total load of the compound  
- Estimated the number and load capacity of required cofrees (distribution boards) and pillars (main cabinets)  
- Organized all load data and calculations in an Excel sheet  
- Created a basic AutoCAD drawing and added the main load values on it  

## Tools Used

- **Microsoft Excel** – for load calculation and organizing data  
- **AutoCAD** – to create a layout with labeled electrical components  

## Notes

- The project was done as part of academic training at Helwan University  
- No simulation or real measurements were included — the focus was on estimation only
